What is This
=============
The original Pebble App [GetBack](https://github.com/samuelmr/pebble-getback) can only set the destination where you are.
Using this Android App, you can set the destination to any spot.

Requirement
===========
This app only works with my fork of pebble. https://github.com/pjmtdw/pebble-getback

How to Use
==========
There are two ways to set the destination:

* Click any [Geo URI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI) in the browser.
* Click marker in Google Maps Application and click "share".
